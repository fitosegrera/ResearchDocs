##Wearable Glitches
What is a glitch? what does it expresses? error? conflict? something wrong? is it a malfunctioning? What does it mean to wear a glitch? Can a garment glitch? can a wearable piece glitch? if so, what does it mean?</br> 
Is it posible to have a fabric that modifies its texture and glitches as a reaction to the wearers body or an aspect of it?</br>  
Ask Ted about good GLITCH theoretical and artistic resources</br>
