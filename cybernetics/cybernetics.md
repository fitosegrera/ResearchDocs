###All Watched Over by Machines of Loving Grace
__by Richard Brautigan__</br>  

I'd like to think (and</br>  
the sooner the better!)</br>  
of a cybernetic meadow</br>  
where mammals and computers</br>  
live together in mutually</br>  
programming harmony</br>  
like pure water</br>  
touching clear sky.</br>  

I like to think</br>  
(right now, please!)</br>  
of a cybernetic forest</br>  
filled with pines and electronics</br>  
where deer stroll peacefully</br>  
past computers</br>  
as if they were flowers</br>  
with spinning blossoms.</br>  

I like to think</br>  
(it has to be!)</br>  
of a cybernetic ecology</br>  
where we are free of our labors</br>  
and joined back to nature,</br>  
returned to our mammal brothers and sisters,</br>  
and all watched over</br>  
by machines of loving grace.</br>
